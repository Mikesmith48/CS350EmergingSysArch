# CS350EmergingSysArch

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The final project for this course was to utilize synchSMs and a task scheduler to create a program for a prototype embedded system that would function as a thermostat.
If the heat detected from the temperature system was less than that of the temperature set point, an led should turn on indicating that the heater is on. Likewise, if the temperature of the system was higher than the set point, the led should turn off. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel like my task scheduler was well implemented and my state machines were configured efficiently. I added inline comments throughout my code annotating what each function or code block was doing.

# Where could you improve?
I could improve my illustration of the task scheduler. Although it was functionally correct, my drawing of it was a bit confusing to follow.

# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Draw.io is one resource I will use more regularly moving forward, it allows for the same capabilities of LucidChart, but without membership requirements. This course has also taught me to pay attention to technical manuals that are included with pieces of hardware, the one for TI board used in this course proved to be very helpful when learning the functions of the buttons and LEDs on the board.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Learning about peripherals and how they interact with one another was another great lesson learned. I will be able to integrate this experience when dealing with other courses/projects that incorporate hardware program development.

# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Included in the folders of each of my uploaded projects are Word documents describing the software that was developed and what its purpose is. These programs are scalable and able to be used on any other boards that share the same architecture. Each of my state machines in the code are clearly labeled and detailed in comments around them.
